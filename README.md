With the goal of recovering high-quality image content from its degraded version, image restoration enjoys numerous applications, 
such as in photography, security, medical imaging, and remote sensing. In this example, we implement the MIRNet model for low-light image enhancement,
a fully-convolutional architecture that learns an enriched set of features that combines contextual information from multiple scales, while simultaneously 
preserving the high-resolution spatial details.
